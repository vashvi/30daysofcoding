Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.





public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int r = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            r ^= n;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
