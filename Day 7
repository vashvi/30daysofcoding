You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.





class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;

        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++) {
            if(buy < prices[i]) {
                profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i]-buy);
            }
            else{
                buy = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
